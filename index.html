      I walked across an empty land
      I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
      I felt the earth beneath my feet
      Sat by the river and it made me complete
      Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
      I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
      So tell me when you're gonna let me in
      I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

      I came across a fallen tree
      I felt the branches of it looking at me
      Is this the place we used to love?
      Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
      Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
      I'm getting old and I need something to rely on
      So tell me when you're gonna let me in
      I'm getting tired and I need somewhere to begin

      And if you have a minute, why don't we go
      Talk about it somewhere only we know?
      This could be the end of everything
      So why don't we go somewhere only we know?
      Somewhere only we know
